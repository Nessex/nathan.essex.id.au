		<p class="subheading">Problem</p>
		<p>Coff-Tek is a local commercial espresso business, with a very small web presence. In June of 2010 and with very little experience making websites, I created a website for Coff-Tek. The website had a lot of useless content and did not have a structure that was appropriate for the business. By 2014 it was overdue for an upgrade, and so I set out to design and implement a site that better fit the needs of Coff-Tek.</p>

		<p class="subheading">Requirements</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Focus on contact details
				<p>The primary goal of this website is to direct customers to the phone number and email address of the business.</p>
			</li>
			<li>Minimal information
				<p>As a small, locally-focused business in the coffee industry, the job description can change a lot depending on the customer. Coff-Tek has a very broad range of experience with espresso equipment, and needed to express this without explicitly defining boundaries for the services offered. Information on services needed to encourage customers to contact the business directly for more information.</p>
			</li>
			<li>Professional appearance
				<p></p>
			</li>
			<li>Low hosting costs &amp; maintenance
				<p>Coff-Tek wanted a website that would not cost much to host and had little to no ongoing maintenance requirements.</p>
			</li>

		</ul>

		<p class="subheading">Design &amp; Results</p>
		<p>In order to meet the requirements, a very simple one page website was constructed. It would have the contact details displayed near the top of the page, and a small information section directly below to give some idea of the services provided.</p>
